# Today I Failed

<p>This site is a sarcastic jab at my fear of failure. As a full-stack developer, I've learned, failed, tried and failed again many times. One thing I've had to overcome is my fear of failure as I'm learning. </p>

<p>My original version of this is just an excel file with my list of failures, reasons, and what I did about it. I created this site as a way for others to laugh at their failures and to see how they overcame them.</p>

<p>Users can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Chart new failures</li>
  <li>Delete failures (A modal appears, "Are you really ashamed of this one? Bury that sucker and hope nobody sees it." [Bury] [Keep]</li>
  <li>View history. Your thrown of shame awaits, my leige.</li>
  <li>View achievements</li>
</ul>
